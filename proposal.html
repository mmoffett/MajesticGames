			<b>Product Description:</b> 
			Our product is a familar game remodeled to represent the magestic animals of our childhood including 5 different animals games. 
			The goal of this product is to design and animate magestic animals.
		
			We would like to create a platform style game website called Majestic Games (title subject to change) that includes 6 separate game themes.
			The problem that we are trying to solve is the disappearance of the games that adults remember playing as children. 
			The goal of this project is to create games reminiscent of our childhood while offering a twist to make them more grownup.
			The idea for this project is similar to that of the current fad of ''adult coloring books,'' coloring books that are typically pages of sophisticated patterns meant to act as a tool for stress relief. 
			Similarly, our platform will attempt to act as stress relief by reminding users of their childhood. 
			The different games will be inspired by our own favorite childhood animals: unicorns, sheep, seahorses, dragons, and narwhals. 
			Each game is based on one of these themes and has an objective. For example, the unicorn game has a castle starry night background.
			The objective of the unicorn game is for the unicorn to jump as high as possible on floating mounds of grass.
